    <h2>Noah Kelley</h2>
    <h2>Moose/Chair</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in Seattle Washington and finished high school in Carlsbad California. I am technically undecided as to what degree I am pursuing, but will probably go into communications.<p>
    </p> I am interested in the film industry and that's where I hope to work. Things I enjoy doing include playing video games, watching anime, writing and reading, and swimming. I served a mission in Seattle Washington and Sao Paulo Brazil. I just got back 10 months ago.<p>
    </p> I am hoping to be able to expand my horizons through my studies at BYUI and Web development is one of those classes that is a completely new concept to me. I donâ€™t know if I will be able to use it effectively in the future, but the more you know the better right?</p>
