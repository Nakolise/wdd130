          <p>Give a detailed description of the rules of the club. GENERAL ETIQUETTE While playing, you are expected to: -Follow the DM’s lead. Refrain from arguing. -Don’t hog the spotlight. -Avoid cross talk & irrelevant conversations. -Discourage bullying or shaming others. -Notify a DM or Manager of disruptive or aggressive behavior. TABLEETIQUETTE -Unless otherwise stated, observe the following: -Only make rolls with the DMs direction and after declaring an action, not before. -Roll dice on the table where results are visible. -Re-roll dice that land askew or roll off the table. -Don’t look up monster stats or enemy spells. -If you and the DM disagree on rules, the DM’s interpretation is the rule for the session. In other words “DM’s word is law.” CharacterRequirements You can play with characters that use the following rules: -New characters here start at 1st Level.Once one of your characters here reaches 7th level, you can start creating new characters at 3rd level instead. -Use the Standard Array (15,14,13,12,10,8), or the Point-Buy method to determine ability scores.No rolling for them. -Your character can use content from official Wizards of the Coast 5e sources only. DMs can add or remove content allowed at their tables. -Add 5 to your character’s maximum hit points. -Use the equipment from your class and background. No rolling for starting wealth. -To keep the game a positive and cooperative experience, your character should not be Chaotic Evil -You cannot play characters of the opposite sex (school rule not ours)</p>
