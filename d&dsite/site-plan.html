Introduction: Begin with a warm and inviting introduction to your club. Explain its role on the college campus and how it contributes to the college community.
Provide a brief overview of what D&D is for those who might not be familiar with the game, emphasizing its role as a collaborative tabletop role-playing game.

Mission and Values: State the club's mission statement, outlining its core objectives and goals. For example, it might be to create a welcoming space for students to enjoy D&D and build a sense of community.
Explain the core values that guide the club, such as inclusivity, creativity, respect, and fair play. Highlight how these values are central to the club's activities.
"Everyone is responsible for making sure that everyone else has an enjoyable time. If anyone feels offended, belittled, or bullied by the actions of another person, the entire purpose of getting together to play is defeated,"

Joining Benefits: Highlight the advantages of joining the club, such as access to gaming materials, a supportive community, learning opportunities, and social connections.

      <h3>Campaign Setting</h3>
      <p>
        Give a detailed description of the setting of the adventures in the club.
        Welcome to the Hold. The world is a dangerous, chaotic place always in need of adventurers. 
        Your character lives at the Hold, a massive city surrounded by towering walls, a melting pot of every race and occupation. 
        This bastion of civilization is ruled by a Grand Council of noblemen and is the only real city left aside from villages and towns scattered across the land.
        
        The Hold 
        The Hold itself is an enormous city protected by massive walls. Within the city are all kinds of areas and districts, including the following:
        -The Markets. Busy streets full of taverns, inns, stores, smiths, and workshops.
        -The University District. Clusters of schools, guildhalls, and scholarly organizations.
        -The Temple District. Sections dedicated to churches, temples, and monasteries.
        -The Groves. Areas of trees and plant life where those close to nature live.
        -The Noble District. Boulevards of noble estates and manors.
        -The Suburbs. Avenues of cottages, houses, and other residencies.
        -The Slums. Run-down streets and unsafe back alleys.
        -The Underdungeon. Underground networks of ancient tunnels, buildings, and caves. 
        At the center of the city is City Square where the massive Grand Tower of the council stands, visible for miles abroad. From there, the city’s main streets, known as the Straights,run outwards to each of the city’s main Gates.
