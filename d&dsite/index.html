          <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
          <p>State the club's mission statement, outlining its core objectives and goals. For example, it might be to create a welcoming space for students to enjoy D&D and build a sense of community. Explain the core values that guide the club, such as inclusivity, creativity, respect, and fair play. Highlight how these values are central to the club's activities. "Everyone is responsible for making sure that everyone else has an enjoyable time. If anyone feels offended, belittled, or bullied by the actions of another person, the entire purpose of getting together to play is defeated,"</p>
