          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Welcome adventurers! This is the website for the Dungeons and Dragons Club here at BYU Idaho in Rexburg. This website was created with the intention of informing those who may be interested in joining us as we explore the perils of the multiverse together! If you are not sure how to play or donâ€™t know anything about the game, fear not! All are welcome within our halls as we have specific tables set aside for new adventurers who might need to learn the mysteries of Dungeons and Dragons. We meet in the MC every Thursday at 6:30, although it is recommended that you arrive at 6:00 sharp as that is when table sign up begins. Yet again I bid you welcome and wish you safe travels on your next adventure!</p>

          <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
          <p>The goal of the BYU Idaho D&D Club is to create a space where those who wish to play Dungeons and Dragons can do so in a welcoming and fun environment. A sense of belonging and community is integral to the enjoyment of everyone involved, so belittling, bullying, discrimination, or any other form of offensive behavior will not be tolerated. Without a spirit of good sportsmanship and teamwork the entire purpose of playing together is destroyed. Core values of the club include creativity, inclusivity, respect, and good humor. We are all here to have fun, so anything that detracts from that, whether it be through the inappropriate actions of others or an unwelcoming environment, must be dealt with in order to maintain good times for all.</p>
